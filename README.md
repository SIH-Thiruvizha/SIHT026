This code defines a Streamlit web application for detecting deep fake images using a pre-trained model hosted on the Hugging Face API. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `API_URL`: The URL of the Hugging Face API endpoint hosting the deep fake detection model.

2. `headers`: Authorization header containing a bearer token required to authenticate requests to the Hugging Face API.

3. `query(image_bytes)`: A function that takes an image file in bytes format, sends a POST request to the Hugging Face API with the image data, and returns the API response as a JSON object.

4. Streamlit UI:
   - A title ('Deep Fake Image Detector') is displayed at the top of the web app.
   - A file uploader is provided for users to select an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).
   - If an image is uploaded, it is displayed in the app.
   - The image is converted to bytes format and stored in `image_bytes`.
   - A button ('Check for Deep Fake') is provided for users to initiate the deep fake detection process.
   - When the button is clicked, the `query` function is called with the image bytes, and the API response is displayed in the app.

Note: This code assumes that the `requests`, `PIL`, `io`, and `streamlit` libraries are imported elsewhere in the code.
